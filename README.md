## Abstract

Over recent years, emerging interest has occurred in inte-
grating computer vision technology into the retail industry.
Automatic checkout (ACO) is one of the critical problems in
this area which aims to automatically generate the shopping
list from the images of the products to purchase. The main
challenge of this problem comes from the large scale and
the fine-grained nature of the product categories as well as
the difficulty for collecting training images that reflect the
realistic checkout scenarios due to continuous update of the
products. Despite its significant practical and research value,
this problem is not extensively studied in the computer vision
community, largely due to the lack of a high-quality dataset.
To fill this gap, in this work we propose a new dataset to
facilitate relevant research. Our dataset enjoys the following
characteristics: (1) It is by far the largest dataset in terms of
both product image quantity and product categories. (2) It
includes single-product images taken in a controlled environ-
ment and multi-product images taken by the checkout system.
(3) It provides different levels of annotations for the check-
out images. Comparing with the existing datasets, ours is
closer to the realistic setting and can derive a variety of
research problems. Besides the dataset, we also benchmark
the performance on this dataset with various approaches.
